# root directories, separated by commas
# on linux you will probably want to add `/`,
# on windows this should be used to add different drive letters
# Examples:
# linux:     root=~/,/
# windows:   root=~/,C:/
root=~/

# characters to separate root directories, each character works individually
# this is in case one is using directories with strange names
root_separators=,;

# number of entries to show on the screen at once
num_entries=20

# wrap the cursor around the top and bottom of the list
wrap=no

# only show files compatible with mpv in the browser
filter_files=yes

# experimental feature that recurses directories concurrently when appending items to the playlist
# this feature has the potential for massive performance improvements when using addons with asynchronous IO
concurrent_recursion=no

# maximum number of recursions that can run concurrently
# if this number is too high it risks overflowing the mpv event queue, which will cause some directories to be dropped entirely
max_concurrency=16

# enable custom keybinds
# the keybind json file must go in ~~/script-opts
custom_keybinds=no

# file-browser only shows files that are compatible with mpv by default
# adding a file extension to this list will add it to the extension whitelist
# extensions are separated with the root separators, do not use any spaces
extension_whitelist=

# add file extensions to this list to disable default filetypes
# note that this will also override audio/subtitle_extension options below
extension_blacklist=

# files with these extensions will be added as additional audio tracks for the current file instead of appended to the playlist
# items on this list are automatically added to the extension whitelist
audio_extensions=mka,dts,dtshd,dts-hd,truehd,true-hd

# items on this list are automatically added to the extension whitelist

# substitude forward slashes for backslashes when appending a local file to the playlist
# may be useful on windows systems
substitute_backslash=no

# interpret backslashes `\` in paths as forward slashes `/`
# this is useful on Windows, which natively uses backslashes.
# As backslashes are valid filename characters in Unix systems this could
# cause mangled paths, though such filenames are rare.
# Use `yes` and `no` to enable/disable. `auto` tries to use the mpv `platform`
# property (mpv v0.36+) to decide. If the property is unavailable it defaults to `yes`.
normalise_backslash=auto

# this option reverses the behaviour of the alt+ENTER keybind
# when disabled the keybind is required to enable autoload for the file
# when enabled the keybind disables autoload for the file
autoload=no

# if autoload is triggered by selecting the currently playing file, then
# the current file will have it's watch-later config saved before being closed and re-opened
# essentially the current file will not be restarted
autoload_save_current=yes

# when opening the browser in idle mode prefer the current working directory over the root
# note that the working directory is set as the 'current' directory regardless, so `home` will
# move the browser there even if this option is set to false
default_to_working_directory=no

# when moving up a directory do not stop on empty protocol schemes like `ftp://`
# e.g. moving up from `ftp://localhost/` will move straight to the root instead of `ftp://`
skip_protocol_schemes=yes

# enables addons

# turn the OSC idle screen off and on when opening and closing the browser
# this should only be enabled if file-browser is the only thing controlling the idle-screen,
# if multiple sources attempt to control the idle-screen at the same time it can cause unexpected behaviour.
toggle_idlescreen=no

# Set the current open status of the browser in the `file_browser/open` field of the `user-data` property.
# This property is only available in mpv v0.36+.
set_user_data=yes

# Set the current open status of the browser in the `file_browser-open` field of the `shared-script-properties` property.
# This property is deprecated. When it is removed in mpv v0.37 file-browser will automatically disable this option.
