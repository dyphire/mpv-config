##‚áò‚áòBasic instructions:
## There is a comment character "#" at the beginning of the line, which means that this item is not enabled (that is, the default setting state of MPV is restored). Delete it to enable it.
## If the partially enabled parameter does not have "=", then this item is actually "yes". For example, deband is turned off by default: --deband is actually equivalent to --deband=yes; by analogy, --deband=no is equivalent to commenting out this parameter.

vo=gpu-next # <gpu/gpu-next/libmpv> video output driver. Many subsequent options also only work properly with these three. The default value of the current version is gpu
## gpu has the highest universality and completeness; gpu-next is discussed here https://github.com/hooke007/MPV_lazy/discussions/39; libmpv is a partial front-end design and is generally not used.
## gpu-next has better prospects. It has currently implemented parsing and mapping of Dolby Vision RPU layer metadata, but does not yet support EL layer metadata parsing.
## For the specific differences between gpu-next and gpu, please see the official wiki for relevant instructions: https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/wiki/GPU-Next-vs-GPU
gpu-api=d3d11 # <opengl/vulkan/d3d11> [Recommended setting is d3d11 when SVP frame filling] Select the graphics drawing interface. The native rendering of windows is d3d11 (mpv is the default for windows, please note that the graphics card turns on the adaptive power mode)
## opengl is the least recommended choice, vulkan's 10bit has not yet been fully implemented https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/issues/8554
## You can set which graphics card mpv uses through d3d11-adapter. See the documentation for details: https://mpv.io/manual/master/#options-d3d11-adapt
### gpu-api choice?
## Linux/macOS: vulkan or opengl, vulkan is recommended
## Windows: vulkan, d3d11 and opengl are all optional. It is recommended to use the native API of d3d11, which has the best performance and achieves 10bit output.
#gpu-context=auto # <win/dxinterop/angle/d3d11/winvk/macvk> Select output backend. This item is usually automatically determined by --gpu-api=<value>; when --gpu-api=opengl, angle is selected by default. In this case, it is best to change to win/dxinterop
#fbo-format=auto # Internal processing precision. This item is usually automatically determined by --gpu-api=<value> to determine the correct value. By default, precision of 16 bits and above is preferred. This parameter cannot be modified under --vo=gpu-next
#d3d11-exclusive-fs=yes # Full screen exclusive under --gpu-api=d3d11
#d3d11-flip=no # [Usually occurs when --d3d11-exclusive-fs=yes and --on-top are used together] Can be used to avoid the screen freezing problem when MPV is in full screen
# If the above problem exists, enable this parameter, otherwise it should not be used, because the flip model under d3d11 has the best performance. After testing, there are performance limitations in flip mode under N card driver. It is recommended to disable it when encountering rendering bottlenecks.
# [When --gpu-context=angle also has a full-screen freeze problem] Use the parameter --angle-flip=no instead of d3d11-flip=no
#d3d11va-zero-copy=yes # [When gpu-api=d3d11] By default, when using hardware decoding with --gpu-api=d3d11, the video image will be copied from the decoder surface (GPU to GPU ) to the shader resource.
# Set this option to avoid copying by sampling directly from the decoder image. This may improve performance and reduce power consumption, but may cause the image to be incorrectly sampled on the bottom and right edges due to padding, and may cause driver errors, as Direct3D 11 technically does not allow sampling from the decoder surface (although Supported by most drivers.)
# When decoding freezes and drops frames, you can enable this to try to improve it.
hwdec=d3d12va-copy,auto-copy # Specify the hardware video decoding API that should be used. Change the soft decoding to no. For hard decoding on Windows, it is recommended to use d3d11va or d3d12va-copy. d3d11va has the best hardware decoding support, providing 4k60 frames in av1 format and native hard decoding acceleration under 8k. Although nvdec supports yuv444 hard decoding, this format is relatively rare and there is no pressure under soft decoding.
# --hwdec=auto-safe is equivalent to --hwdec=yes. When --gpu-api=d3d11, the value auto prefers d3d11va; when --gpu-api=vulkan, the value auto prefers nvdec. auto-copy prefers d3d11va-copy
# It is not recommended to use the native hard solution without -copy, which has the highest theoretical decoding efficiency. The purpose is to ensure that all settings/filters/shaders function properly (some are not supported). Note that the nvdec hard solution without -copy does not support d3d11, only vulkan and opengl.
## You can also use a priority list composed of multiple values. For example, the values ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äãvulkan-copy, nvdec-copy, auto mean that these decoding modes are tried in sequence.
## When using auto without specifying a specific hard solution API, it is recommended to use the auto-safe parameter. This will give priority to finding hard solution APIs actively supported by developers (d3d11va or nvdec under Windows)
## The hard solution mode may encounter some problems. It is recommended to use the soft solution first (the official manual does not recommend the use of hard solution)
## After testing, it was found that the copy hard decoding mode under --vo=gpu will cause abnormal frame drops when the video frame rate is >=60fps in 4K and above. It is recommended to use the soft decoding mode or the hard decoding without copy mode.
#hwdec-codecs=all # Try hard decoding for encoding formats in the selected range. The default value of the current version is --hwdec-codecs="h264,vc1,hevc,vp8,vp9,av1,prores"
#vd-lavc-dr=no # [When gpu-api=d3d11] Enable direct rendering (default: auto). If set to yes, video will be decoded directly to GPU video memory (or scratch buffer)
# If set to no, the video will be decoded into system memory and then copied to GPU memory. This may cause a performance hit, but may resolve the issue on some low-end Intel GPUs
# The default value auto will be automatically selected based on the decoder and GPU capabilities (that is, automatically disabled for low-end intel GPU devices)
#vd-queue-enable=yes # Enable video decoder queue (default: no). If set to yes, the video decoder will run on a separate thread, which may cause performance degradation, but may solve the problem on some low-end Intel GPUs
#vd-lavc-threads=8 # Number of threads used for decoding. Whether threading is actually supported depends on the codec (default: 0). 0 means automatically detect the number of cores on the machine and use it, up to 16. You can manually set more than 16 threads
#vd-lavc-assume-old-x264=yes # Assume the video was encoded by an old, buggy version of x264 (default: no). Only try to enable this when x264 yuv444p10 format video decoding error solves ffmpeg's compatibility issue with old x264 encoding
#opengl-pbo=yes # Enable PBO. On some drivers this may be faster, especially if the source video size is large (such as so-called "4K" videos). On other drivers it may be slower or cause latency issues
##‚áò‚áòHow to deal with dual graphics card laptops
#vd=h264_qsv,hevc_qsv,mpeg2_qsv,vp9_qsv,vp8_qsv,av1_qsv
# Under the configuration combination of Intel core graphics & NVDIA_MX_x50, if you use independent graphics rendering, because the MX series independent graphics do not have a decoding unit, even if you use hwdec to specify hard decoding, you can still only use soft decoding.
# Use this parameter to use the core graphics hard decoding and auxiliary rendering while allowing the independent graphics main rendering (when hwdec=no, fast forwarding may cause MPV to freeze, it is recommended to use the xxxx-copy decoding method)
#d3d11-adapter="NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 Super"
# [When gpu-api=d3d11] Specify a certain graphics card as the main rendering output. By default, the system-specified main rendering graphics card is automatically selected.
# You can view the graphics card name in Task Manager and change it accordingly. This parameter is equivalent to setting it in the driver panel to run mpv on a standalone display.
# For example, when using the internal screen of an I+N dual-display notebook, "Intel(R) UHD Graphics" is actually used. Modifying this example to specify independent display can reduce the 3D rendering ratio of the dual-display card in the task manager.
# Most laptops with dual graphics cards behave like "direct display direct connection" when connected to a monitor. At this time, the independent display output is automatically used without this parameter.
# [When gpu-api=vulkan] Use parameter --vulkan-device instead of --d3d11-adapter
#vulkan-device="NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 Super"
# [When gpu-api=vulkan] This parameter replaces --d3d11-adapter to perform the functions of the specified graphics card
# Default is empty, example value is "NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 Super" (the complete device name or UUID must be used)

 ### Video related settings are set using configuration groups. The following are only parameter examples. For specific settings, see the relevant configuration group parameters of [General Parameter Supplementary Area] and [Configuration Group] below. 

 ##‚áò‚áòThe following are ICC color management related parameter settings
#icc-profile="~~/icc/ITU-RBT709ReferenceDisplay.icc" 
# Load the ICC profile and use it to convert video RGB to screen output, and select the icc profile for the monitor's corresponding color gamut. This option overrides the --target-prim, --target-trc and --icc-profile-auto options
## Since the mpv color calibration target is bt.1886 (close to gamma=2.4), when the --icc-profile-auto parameter is enabled to use the system-specified (srgb) color calibration file, the gamma curve of the (srgb) color calibration file will be Usually gamma2.2, which will cause the mpv screen to display abnormally
## In response to the above problems, it is best to manually specify the gamma curve as the corresponding monitor color gamut color calibration file of gamma2.4. Sample parameters are available for reference.
#icc-profile-auto # If you have done professional color correction, you can turn it on (the corresponding icm color correction document exists in the system directory). For wide color gamut screens that have not been calibrated, target-prim=<value> should be specified manually.
# Enabling color management allows videos in the standard color space to display relatively correct colors on wide color gamut displays. Turning it off will restore the oversaturated state.
# Currently, when mpv uses icc color management, since the color calibration curve target is bt.1886, it will cause problems such as color cast and dark screen on most displays https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/issues/ 8009
## Enable the parameter --icc-force-contrast=1000, which can solve the problem of dark images due to extremely high contrast in some color correction files (use this option to test reasonable values ‚Äã‚Äãfor OLED screens). #! Note that the problem of dark hdr mapping pictures still cannot be solved
# Or use the --target-prim=<value> parameter to manage the color space
#icc-intent=0 # ICC color conversion mapping intent, 0: perceptibility, 1: relative colorimetric (default value), 2: saturated, 3: absolute colorimetric. It is recommended to use perceptual mapping https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/issues/8009#issuecomment-923607273
#icc-force-contrast=1000 # <no|0-1000000|inf> Color management. Overwrite the static contrast data in the ICC file. The default no is no overwriting. oled can be set to inf, which is infinite (if the data in the ICC is lost, it will automatically fall back to 1000). This item only affects the content display of bt.1886.
## Ordinary LCD generally uses 1000 (subject to the panel's native data); users using OLED display devices try to use 1000000 or the special value inf. Setting the LCD to 1000 can solve the problem that some color calibration files have extremely high contrast, causing the black part to be too dark.
#icc-3dlut-size=64x64x64 # <Default auto|RxGxB> The size of the 3D LUT generated from the ICC profile for each dimension. Range<2--512>
#icc-cache=no # Whether to store the 3dlut cache of ICC configuration files locally, enabled by default
#icc-cache-dir="~~/cache/icc_cache" # Specify the directory to store and load 3D LUTs created from ICC profiles. This can be used to speed up loading. Please note that these files contain uncompressed LUTs. Their size depends on --icc-3dlut-size and can be very large. NOTE: This will not clear automatically, so old, unused cache files may linger indefinitely
## The 3dlut generated by the cache should have an acceleration effect, but insufficient hard disk IO performance may have a counterproductive effect. You can choose whether to disable it according to the actual situation.
#use-embedded-icc-profile=no # Load embedded ICC profiles contained in media files (such as PNG images). (Default: yes). Note that this option under --vo=gpu is only effective when also using a display ICC profile (--icc-profile or --icc-profile-auto) 

 ##‚áò‚áòThe following are target color management related parameter settings
#target-prim=auto # Wide color gamut screens should set this parameter to a specific value to solve the problem of color oversaturation. When ICC color management is not used, the video color will adapt to this color space. There is no need to change this default value (bt.709) for srgb screens. Other examples: 99% of argb screens write adobe, 90%+ of p3 color gamut screens write dci-p3
# Using the --target-prim=<value> parameter to manage the color space will cause a color cast problem under hdr. Enabling the --gamut-mapping-mode=clip parameter during hdr mapping can solve this problem https://github. com/mpv-player/mpv/issues/9071
#target-gamut=dci-p3 # Explicitly limit the display's color gamut. You can use this option to limit the output color gamut, such as DCIP3-in-BT.2020; set `--target-prim` to the color space specification and `--target-gamut` to the output color to limit domain. Depends on `--target-prim`. (only available with `--vo=gpu-next`)
#target-trc=gamma2.2 # Specify the transmission characteristics (gamma) of the display, effective when icc color management is not used. Default value auto: use gamma2.2 under hdr under --vo=gpu, no processing under sdr; always use bt.1886 curve under --vo=gpu-next (assuming infinite contrast, that is, oled)
# It is recommended that monitors other than OLED and HDR always use the gamma2.2 curve to avoid too dark MPV images. For hdr pass-through, this item needs to use auto or pq value
#target-contrast=auto # <auto|10-1000000|inf> Specifies the measured contrast of the output display. This is used in conjunction with --target-peak to calculate the display black point for black point compensation during HDR tone mapping
# The default value is auto, which assumes a 1000:1 contrast ratio (considered a typical SDR monitor), which when pass-through HDR will have infinite contrast. inf contrast specifies display capabilities with perfect black levels, i.e. OLED displays
#target-peak=auto # <auto|nits> Specifies the measured peak brightness of the output display. Affected by the --target-trc parameter, the default value auto: use the appropriate value according to the trc parameter. The default value for sdr is 203. Under hdr, it is recommended to specify the specific nits value according to the actual display effect.
# When using icc color management, if nits is set higher than the default value (203), the monitor will be treated as an hdr screen by mpv
# Try not to modify this parameter under --vo=gpu-next to avoid abnormal screen performance.
##‚áò‚áòThe following are 3dlut related parameters
#lut=<file> # [Effective when --vo=gpu-next], specifies a custom LUT (Adobe .cube format) to be applied to the color as part of the color conversion. The exact way depends on --lut-type
#lut-type=conversion # [Effective when --lut=<file> is enabled], < defaults to auto|native|normalized|conversion>, controls the color of incoming and outgoing LUTs specified as --lut value way
# auto: Automatically select LUT from tagged metadata, otherwise fall back to system (default); native: Applied to the original image content in its native RGB color space before converting to the output color space (non-linear light)
# normalized: Applied to normalized RGB image content under linear lighting before conversion to output color space
# conversion: Full replacement conversion from image color space to output color space. If such a LUT exists, it has highest priority and overrides any ICC profile and options related to tone mapping and output chroma (--target-prim, --target-trc, etc.)
#target-lut=<file> # [Effective when --vo=gpu-next], specify a custom LUT file (Adobe .cube format) to apply to colors before displaying on screen
# After encoding to the target color space, this LUT provides values ‚Äã‚Äãin normalized RGB form, so will be processed after the parameter --target-trc
#image-lut=<file> # [Effective when --vo=gpu-next] Specifies a custom LUT file (Adobe .cube format) to apply to colors during image decoding. The exact way the LUT is used depends on --image-lut-type
#image-lut-type=conversion # [Effective when --image-lut=<file> is enabled], < defaults to auto|native|normalized|conversion>, and control incoming and outgoing is specified as --image -lut LUT color value method
# auto: Automatically select LUT from tagged metadata, otherwise fall back to system (default); native: Apply to original image content in original color space before decoding to RGB. For example for an HDR10 image this will input a PQ encoded YCbCr value in the range 0.0-1.0
# normalized: applied to normalized RGB image content, after decoding from its native color encoding, but before linearization
# conversion: Completely replaces color decoding. This type of LUT should ingest the native color space of the image and output a normalized non-linear RGB
##‚áò‚áòThe following are hdr related parameters
#inverse-tone-mapping=yes # <yes|Default no> [effective when --vo=gpu-next], if set, allows inverse tone mapping (extending SDR to HDR), only on HDR devices valid on. The use of some tone mapping curves is not supported, please use with caution
#target-colorspace-hint=yes # <Default auto|yes|no> [effective when --vo=gpu-next], if possible, automatically configure the display's output color space to pass the input value of the media stream (e.g. HDR pass-through). Requires driver support
# Windows needs to manually switch the display HDR mode (Windows limitation)
#tone-mapping=hable # Tone mapping algorithm, other recommended ones are clip|mobius|reinhard|hable|bt.2390|gamma|spline|bt.2446a|st2094-10|st2094-40, the default is auto, according to the internal Heuristic method selects the best curve (actually spline under --vo=gpu-next)
# spline, bt.2446a, st2094-10 and st2094-40 algorithms are only available under --vo=gpu-next
## When vo=gpu, it is recommended to use hable or bt.2390 for testing. hable retains better details, bt.2390 has better contrast
## When vo=gpu-next is used, it is currently recommended to use spline, hable and bt.2446a for testing. When used with --hdr-compute-peak, the spline mapping algorithm has the best tone mapping performance within mpv currently.
#tone-mapping-param=0.3 # Small parameter for tone mapping algorithm. hable and bt.2446a have no parameters; bt.2390 has no parameters under --vo=gpu, and the default value is 1.0 under -vo=gpu-next; st2094-10 defaults to 0.7/mobius and spline defaults to 0.5/reinhard and defaults to 0.5/gamma. 1.8 (default value is 0.3 under --vo=gpu-next)
# Recommended value when using bt.2390 under -vo=gpu-next: 2.0 or the value 0.5 in the ITU-R specification
#tone-mapping-max-boost=1.0 # <1.0-10.0> Maximum exposure multiple of average brightness, default: 1.0. Increasing this value can reveal hidden details in dark areas; too high can make dark areas look unnaturally bright. You can try the performance under 1.0 and 1.33, only available under --vo=gpu
#gamut-mapping-mode=clip # <Default auto|clip|perceptual|relative|saturation|absolute|linear|warn|desaturate|darken> Specifies how the desired target display gamut should be handled after any tone mapping is completed , default auto: automatically select the best mode (actual application perceptual)
# clip: RGB each channel is hard-cut to the target color gamut, it is recommended to use it first; perceptual: Use soft knees to perform perceptually balanced color gamut mapping, with the function of rolling off the clipping area, and the hue conversion function to maintain saturation
# relative: perform relative colorimetric shearing while maintaining the exponential relationship between brightness and chroma; saturation: perform a simple RGB->RGB saturation mapping. Will never cut, but will distort all tones and/or cause a faded look
# absolute: Perform absolute colorimetric shearing. Like 'relative', but does not adapt to the white point; linear: linearly/uniformly desaturates the image to bring the entire image into the target color gamut
# warn: simply highlight out-of-gamut pixels; desaturate: perform constant brightness colorimetric clipping, reducing color saturation towards white until they are within range; darken: uniformly darken the input slightly to prevent blowout clipping and highlighting, then colorimetrically clamped to the input gamut boundary, with a slight bias to preserve the chromaticity of the luminance
#hdr-contrast-recovery=0.30 # <0.0-2.0> Enables the HDR contrast recovery algorithm, which is designed to enhance the contrast of HDR video after tone mapping. Only available with --vo=gpu-next
# Strength (default: 0.0) indicates the degree of contrast restoration, 0.0 means completely disabled, 1.0 means 100% strength. Values ‚Äã‚Äãgreater than 1.0 are allowed, but may result in oversharpening
## The default value of this parameter in the mpv built-in configuration group gpu-hq is 0.30
#hdr-contrast-smoothness=3.5 # <1.0-100.0> Enables the HDR contrast smoothing algorithm, which is designed to enhance the smoothness of HDR video after tone mapping. Only available with --vo=gpu-next
# Smoothness (default: 3.5) indicates how low-pass the HDR source is to obtain contrast information, a value of 2.0 corresponds to a 2x downscaling. Users with low DPI monitors (<= 100) may wish to lower this value, while users with very high DPI monitors ("Retina") may wish to increase this value
#hdr-compute-peak=yes # <Default auto|yes|no> This option basically provides dynamic scene-based tone mapping (older graphics cards do not support this parameter, and the picture will become pale) , which may cause the brightness to change and flicker when the scene changes.
# Currently, when --hdr-compute-peak is enabled, highlight details are easily lost or overexposed under some tone mapping curves (bt.2390, reinhard); there are also significant improvements under some tone mapping curves (spline, bt.2446a, hable )
#hdr-peak-decay-rate=20 # [Effective when --hdr-compute-peak=yes], the decay rate used for the HDR peak detection algorithm (<0.0-1000.0> default value: 20.0)
#hdr-scene-threshold-low=1.0 # [Effective when --hdr-compute-peak=yes], the lower threshold (dB) of the brightness difference will be considered a scene change (<0.0-100.0> default Value: 1.0)
#hdr-scene-threshold-high=3.0 # [Effective when --hdr-compute-peak=yes], the upper threshold (dB) of the brightness difference will be considered a scene change (<0.0-100.0> default Value: 3.0)
#hdr-peak-percentile=100 # Effective when [--hdr-compute-peak=yes] and [-vo=gpu-next]. (<0.0-100.0>Default: 100.0) Specifies which percentile of the input image brightness histogram is considered the true peak
# If set to 100 (default), measure the brightest pixel. Otherwise, the top allocation of frequencies is gradually cut off. Setting it too low will result in clipping of very bright detail, but can increase the dynamic brightness of scenes with very bright isolated highlights. Values ‚Äã‚Äãother than 100 incur a small performance penalty
## If you feel that the brightness of the picture is always jumping, you can ignore some of the peaks by lowering this parameter. It is not recommended to go below 99.7.
## The default value of this parameter in the mpv built-in configuration group gpu-hq is 99.995
#allow-delayed-peak-detect=no # Effective when [--hdr-compute-peak=yes] and [-vo=gpu-next], default no. When using --hdr-compute-peak, allow the detected peak to be delayed by one frame when it benefits performance
# Especially when advanced rendering is not required, this can avoid unnecessary FBO processing. Note that -vo=gpu defaults to latency peak processing 

 ##‚áò‚áòThe following are related parameter settings for adjusting the screen effect.
#video-sync=display-resample # "ReClock"-like function, changed to synchronize the video frame with the display refresh rate, automatically adjust the audio speed to compensate for the offset. # It is recommended to turn off SVP when adding frames.
# Default audio (synchronized to audio/system clock) is generally the most compatible but has occasional frame drops and duplication
#video-sync-max-video-change=5 # [Only takes effect when --video-sync=display-xxxx] Default value: 1
#interpolation # [Only effective when --video-sync=display-xxxx] Reduce stuttering (also known as picture jitter) caused by mismatch between video fps and display refresh rate. # It is recommended to turn off SVP when adding frames.
# The algorithm used for interpolation. For details, see https://mpv.io/manual/master/#options-tscale
# For some discussions, see https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/issues/2685
#interpolation-preserve=no # [Effective when --vo=gpu-next], default is yes. The interpolation results from the previous frame are retained even if the renderer parameters are changed. Except for options related to cropping and video placement, which always invalidate cache
# Enabling this option will result in smoother dynamic updates of renderer settings, at the cost of slightly higher latency in responding to such changes
#tscale=oversample # [Effective only when --interpolation is turned on] Select the time domain interpolation algorithm (non-MEMC motion compensation). # It is recommended to turn off SVP when adding frames.
#The default interpolation algorithm is oversample. Overall, mitchell is smoother (of course not as good as SVP frame interpolation), but there will be blur. oversample has no blur, but is not smooth (basically restores the appearance of 24 frames, the effect is similar to MADVR's smoothmotion), triangle is between the two, catmull_rom is relatively sharp
# Please choose which one to choose based on your own needs.
#tscale-radius=1.0 # Set the radius of the adjustable filter, which must be a floating point number between 0.5 and 16.0. If not specified, defaults to the filter's preferred radius. Not available for every scaler and VO combination
#tscale-clamp=0.0 # <0.0-1.0> Specifies the weight bias to be multiplied by a negative coefficient. Specifying --scale-clamp=1 has the effect of completely removing negative weights, effectively limiting the value range to [0-1]. A value between 0.0 and 1.0 can be specified to apply only moderately reduced negative weights
#tscale The default value of this item is 1.0, which can effectively reduce the ringing artifacts produced by tscale. The default value for other scale algorithms is 0.0
#tscale-antiring=1.0 # Set the anti-ringing strength. This attempts to eliminate ringing, but introduces other artifacts in the process. Must be a floating point number between 0.0 and 1.0. Default value 0.0 completely disables anti-ringing
# Note that this does not affect the special filters bilinear and bicubic_fast
#dither-depth=auto # <N|no|Default auto> Whether to enable color depth dithering to compensate for color conversion loss. Write 8 for an 8-bit display and 10 for a 10-bit display. The value of auto depends on --gpu-api, which may not be correct. 10bit must be manually specified under vulkan. See issue status: https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/issues/8554
# If the display with 8 jitter and 10 dither uses 10 and there is abnormal output, change it back to the value 8
#dither=fruit # <Default fruit|ordered|error-diffusion|no> [effective when --dither-depth is enabled], select color depth dithering algorithm
# The error-diffusion algorithm has the best effect and consumes the most energy. When the performance is insufficient, it will automatically fall back to the fruit algorithm.
#dither-size-fruit=6 # [Effective when --dither=fruit], <2-8> Set the size of the color depth dither matrix (default: 6). The actual size of the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äã(2^N)x(2^N) and the option value is N, so 6 is actually 64x64
#error-diffusion=sierra-lite # <simple|Default sierra-lite|floyd-steinberg|atkinson> [Effective when --dither=error-diffusion], the algorithm core used by error-diffusion
#temporal-dither # [Effective when --dither-depth is enabled], enable the temporal color depth dithering algorithm (ie, inter-frame mixed color depth dithering algorithm)
# This varies between 8 different dither modes on each frame by changing the direction of the tiling dither matrix. This may cause flickering on the LCD display
#temporal-dither-period=1 # <1-128> [Effective when --temporal-dither is enabled], determines how often color depth dither mode is updated when in use. 1 (default) will update on every video frame 

 #scale=ewa_hanning # Amplification algorithm, the default algorithm is lanczos, the recommended algorithms are --ewa_lanczos, --ewa_lanczossharp and --ewa_hanning, that is, the jinc algorithm and its variants
# ewa_hanning can reduce ringing compared to other jinc algorithms
# Among the built-in scale algorithms, the spline36 algorithm is more suitable for real-shot images, and the ewa algorithm is more suitable for anime images.
#scale-radius=3.2383154841662362 # Set the radius of the adjustable filter, which must be a floating point number between 0.5 and 16.0. If not specified, defaults to the filter's preferred radius. Not available for every scaler and VO combination
#scale-antiring=1.0 # Set the anti-ringing strength. This attempts to eliminate ringing, but introduces other artifacts in the process. Must be a floating point number between 0.0 and 1.0. Default value 0.0 completely disables anti-ringing
# Note that this does not affect the special filters bilinear and bicubic_fast
## There is basically no need to enable this when using external upscale class shaders
#cscale=bilinear # Chroma reduction algorithm; if not specified, --scale is automatically used (not recommended). It is recommended to use the bilinear algorithm. The differential perception of the chroma upscaling algorithm is not obvious, and generally there is no need to invest too much performance.
# In actual tests, it was found that the bilinear algorithm is more suitable for poorer film sources, while the catmull_rom algorithm is more suitable for better film sources.
# Although "KrigBilateral.glsl" has the best effect, the combination of special video sources (VFR) and special shaders may cause excessive energy consumption.
#cscale-radius=3 # Set the radius of the adjustable filter, which must be a floating point number between 0.5 and 16.0. If not specified, defaults to the filter's preferred radius. Not available for every scaler and VO combination
#cscale-antiring=1.0 # Set the anti-ringing strength. This attempts to eliminate ringing, but introduces other artifacts in the process. Must be a floating point number between 0.0 and 1.0. Default value 0.0 completely disables anti-ringing
# Note that this does not affect the special filters bilinear and bicubic_fast
## There is basically no need to enable this when using external cscale class shaders
#dscale=catmull_rom # Reduction algorithm. The default algorithm is hermite
# When only using the built-in dscale algorithm, bicubic (catmull_rom is recommended in the variant) or ewa_hanning is recommended. You can also test the effects of robidouxsharp, ewa_robidouxsharp and other algorithms by yourself.
#dscale-radius=1 # Set the radius of the adjustable filter, which must be a floating point number between 0.5 and 16.0. If not specified, defaults to the filter's preferred radius. Not available for every scaler and VO combination
#dcale-antiring=1.0 # Set the anti-ringing strength. This attempts to eliminate ringing, but introduces other artifacts in the process. Must be a floating point number between 0.0 and 1.0. Default value 0.0 completely disables anti-ringing
# Note that this does not affect the special filters bilinear and bicubic_fast
## There is basically no need to enable this when using external dcale class shaders
#linear-upscaling=no # [Requires --fbo-format to specify 16-bit and above precision; incompatible with --sigmoid-upscaling] (no impact on HDR content)
#sigmoid-upscaling=no # [Not compatible with --linear-upscaling] Non-linear color conversion when upscaling to avoid strong ringing artifacts. Enabled by default
## Developers recommend either using --sigmoid-upscaling first, or using neither of the above at all (i.e. scaling under gamma light)
## There is basically no need to enable this when using external upscale class shaders
#correct-downscaling=yes # [This is invalid when --dscale=bilinear] Enhance the quality of the downscaling algorithm (anti-aliasing), which may produce slight distortion for videos with unusual ratios. Enabled by default
## Can be replaced by the better "SSimDownscaler.glsl" shader solution
#linear-downscaling=no # [Must be turned off when using "SSimDownscaler.glsl"; --fbo-format must specify 16-bit and above precision] (no impact on HDR content). Enabled by default
## The parameters of the last two items --linear- correspond to "scale in linear light" in MADVR. When zooming out, linear processing can improve the accuracy of color contrast and suppress ringing artifacts produced by some algorithms.
#scaler-resizes-only=no # The default is yes. When scaling processing is not performed, the bilinear algorithm is used to restore perfectly. When disabled, the specified scale value is used for processing even if the size is not changed. This can correct the half-scale problem introduced by nnedi3 and ravu. Pixel offset (but not necessary)
#deband=no # Eliminate the color band, no need to stay, you can choose to open it manually depending on the video source
#deband-iterations=1 # <0-16> The number of times to perform debanding. The higher the intensity, the more time-consuming and labor-intensive it is. The value >4 is actually invalid (default 1). 3-4 is equivalent to setting madvr's deband to high. Effect
#deband-threshold=48 # <0-4096> Filter cutoff threshold, higher numbers will increase intensity but gradually reduce image detail (default 48)
#deband-range=16 # <1-64> Initial radius, the larger the value, the stronger the color band and the higher the performance consumption; the smaller the value, the smoother it is (default value 16). If you increase --deband-iterations, you need to decrease this value to compensate
#deband-grain=32 # <0-4096> Adds additional dynamic noise to help cover up remaining quantization artifacts (default 32)

#sub-ass-use-video-data=none # <none|aspect-ratio|Default all> Controls what information about the video stream is passed to libass. Any option other than 'all' is incompatible with standard ASS and VSFilter
## For some types of damaged ASS files you may need to try setting 'aspect-ratio' to get normal rendering; when a damaged ASS file on anamorphic video renders stretched, try setting 'none' to fix it, this parameter will not correct Non-anamorphic video makes an impact
#sub-ass-video-aspect-override=16:9 # <Default no|ratio> allows arbitrary aspect ratios to be passed to libass instead of the actual aspect ratio of the video. Zero or negative aspect ratio is equivalent to 'no'
## This has no effect when option 'sub-ass-use-video-data' is set to none
#sub-vsfilter-bidi-compat=yes # <yes|Default no> When enabled, implicit bidirectional detection is set to "ltr" instead of "auto" to match the default behavior of ass. It should only be enabled if subtitle bidirectional detection fails
## This only affects text-only (non-ASS) subtitles
#sub-ass-style-overrides-append=Encoding=-1 # Force style: enable auto-detection. Can be used to fix recognition errors in character encoding and text direction, and improve the rendering of some ass tags
#sub-ass-style-overrides-append=ScaledBorderAndShadow=no
# Force style: Do not scale borders and shadows. Can prevent the so-called "heavy ink" style https://github.com/libass/libass/issues/287
# Note: This problem has been fixed in the git version after libass 0.15.2 

 #sub-gauss=1.5 # <0.0-3.0> Apply Gaussian blur to image subtitles (default: 0). This helps make pixelated DVD/Vobsub look better
#sub-gray=yes # Convert image subtitles to grayscale. Can help make pornographic DVDs/Vobsubs look better
#sub-fix-timingyes # Adjust subtitle timing to remove small gaps or overlaps between subtitles (remove gaps or overlaps if the difference is less than 210 ms). In some cases this may make the situation worse, in which case try disabling this. Disabled by default
#sub-stretch-durations=yes # Extend the duration of subtitles so they end when the next subtitle starts. Might help with subtitles incorrectly having zero duration, but equally likely breaks normal subtitles. Disabled by default
#sub-fps # Specify the frame rate of the subtitle file (default: video fps). Only affects text subtitles
#sub-speed=24/23.976 # Multiply the subtitle event timestamp by the given value. Can be used to fix the playback speed of frame-based subtitle formats. Only affects text subtitles
# --sub-speed=24/23.976 Play frame-based subtitles, assuming the frame rate is 23.976, 24 frames per second
#stretch-dvd-subs=yes # Stretch DVD subtitles when playing anamorphic videos, disabled by default
#sub-filter-regex-plain=yes # Whether to first convert the ASS "text" field to plain text (default: no). This strips ASS tags and applies ASS directives (such as \N) to newlines. If the result is multi-line, the regex anchors ^ and $ match each line, but any match will still drop all lines
#sub-filter-regex-warn=yes # Log discarded lines with a warning log level instead of verbose (default: no). helpful for testing
#sub-filter-regex-enable=no # Whether to enable regular expression filtering (default value: yes), the following two parameters will not take effect when they are empty
#sub-filter-regex-append=opensubtitles\.org # --sub-filter-regex-...=... Set a list of regular expressions to match text subtitles, and remove any matching lines (default: null) matching is case-insensitive, but how you do this depends on libc, and will most likely only work with ASCII. It doesn't work with bitmap/image subtitles
#sub-filter-jsre-append= # Same as --sub-filter-regex, but uses JavaScript regular expressions. Shared/affected by all --sub-filter-regex-* control options, only requires JavaScript support 

 ##‚áò‚áòSubtitle settings, when there is no built-in style
#sub-fonts-dir=~~/fonts # Specify the font search directory for text subtitles, the example is the default value

sub-bold=yes # Use bold style for text subtitles
#sub-italic=yes # Use italic style for text subtitles
sub-color="#FFFFFFFF" # Text subtitle font color. The format of < is (AA)RRGGBB> AA is hexadecimal transparency, RRGGBB is hexadecimal color representation
#sub-back-color="#FF262626" # Text subtitle background color

#sub-use-margins=no # Whether to output plain text subtitles with black borders, the default is yes
#sub-pos=100 # Specify the position of the subtitles on the screen. This value is the vertical position of the subtitle as a percentage of the screen height. Default is 100, values ‚Äã‚Äãabove 100 will move downward. Affects ass subtitles and plain text subtitles
#sub-margin-x=25 # The left and right screen margins of the sub item in scaled pixels. This option specifies the distance of the sub to the left and the distance from the right border.
#sub-margin-y=22 # Top and bottom screen margins for the sub in scaled pixels, this option specifies vertical margins for plain text subtitles. If you only want to increase the vertical subtitle position, use --sub-pos
#sub-align-x=center # <left|Default center|right> Controls which corner of the screen the text subtitles should be aligned to. Never applied to ASS subtitles except in --no-sub-ass mode. Again, this does not work for PGS image subtitles
#sub-align-y=bottom # <top|center|Default bottom> controls the vertical position of text subtitles
#sub-justify=left # <Default auto|left|center|right> Controls the alignment of multi-line subtitles (default: auto, aligned according to --sub-align-y definition). It is recommended to align left
#sub-ass-justify=yes # If --sub-ass-override is not set to no, apply --sub-justify on ASS subtitles. Default value: no

 ### The following preset parameters are only for capturing the highest quality pictures.
screenshot-format=webp # <Default jpg|(same as before)jpeg|png|webp|jxl|avif>
#screenshot-png-compression=7 # <0-9> PNG compression level. Too high a level affects performance. The default is 7
#screenshot-png-filter=5 # Set the filter to be applied before PNG compression. 0 is none, 1 is sub, 2 is up, 3 is average, 4 is Paeth, 5 is mixed, which affects the level of compression that can be achieved. Mixed achieves the best compression for most images, so it is the default setting.
#screenshot-jpeg-quality=100 # <0-100> The highest quality of JPEG, the default is 90
#screenshot-jpeg-source-chroma=no # Write JPEG with the same chroma half-sampling as the source video, default yes
#screenshot-webp-lossless=yes # Lossless WEBP, default no
screenshot-webp-quality=85 # <0-100> [Effective when --screenshot-webp-lossless=no] Destroys the quality of WEBP, default 75
screenshot-webp-compression=6 # <0-6> WEBP compression level. Too high a level affects performance. The default is 4. NOTE: This will also affect image quality when using lossy WEBP
#screenshot-jxl-distance=0 # <0-15> The visual model distance of JXL, 0 means lossless quality, 0.1 means visual lossless, the default 1 is equivalent to 90 quality of JPEG
#screenshot-jxl-effort=5 # <1-9> JXL compression level, too high level affects performance, default 4
screenshot-tag-colorspace=no # Tag screenshots with appropriate colorspace (not all formats are supported). Default yes
#screenshot-high-bit-depth=no # Mainly affects PNG and JPEG XL. Try to use the same bit depth as the video output. The default is yes. NOTE: Using the same bit depth will significantly increase the final size of the png/jxl
#screenshot-sw=yes # Whether to use software rendering for screenshots, default: no. If set to yes, a software scaler is used to convert the video to RGB (or whatever is required for the target screenshot). Software renderers may lack some features, such as HDR rendering
screenshot-template="~~/files/screen/%{media-title}-%P-%n"

# Script filter shader #
#################### 

 gpu-shader-cache-dir="~~/cache/shaders_cache" # Specify the directory to store compiled GPU shaders to speed up startup. Enabled by default
## Notice! If not placed under APPDATA, make sure the folder has user write permissions.
## The shader generated by the cache should have an acceleration effect, but insufficient hard disk IO performance may have a counterproductive effect. You can choose whether to disable it according to the actual situation.
##‚áò‚áòScript part
##Built-in script switch (if there is no necessary purpose, then do not block the built-in functions of mpv)
#load-scripts=no # Automatically load all external scripts in the scripts subdirectory in the same directory as the configuration file. The default is yes. When set to no, you can use the command in the next line of example to load the specified external script, which is not recommended.
#scripts="~~/scripts/autoload.lua;~~/scripts/playlistmanager.lua;~~/scripts/open_dialog.lua"
#load-auto-profiles=no # <yes|no|Default auto> enables mpv built-in conditional configuration script [auto_profiles.lua]
#load-osd-console=no # Enable mpv built-in console script [console.lua], default yes
#load-stats-overlay=no # Enable mpv's built-in statistics script [stats.lua], default is yes
#ytdl=no # Enable mpv's built-in URL parsing enhancement script [ytdl-hook.lua], default yes
#ytdl-format=bestvideo+bestaudio/best # <ytdl|best|worst|mp4|webm|...> Video format/quality passed directly to youtube-dl. Default value: bestvideo+bestaudio/best
## ytdl does not pass the --format option to youtube-dl and therefore does not override its default value. Note that sometimes youtube-dl returns a format that mpv cannot use, in these cases the mpv default may be better
#ytdl-raw-options=sub-langs="en.*",write-subs=,write-auto-subs=
#ytdl-raw-options-append=write-subs=
#ytdl-raw-options-append=yes-playlist=
#ytdl-raw-options-append=cookies-from-browser=Firefox # Pass and use browser cookies, supporting Firefox, Chrome, Chromium, Edge, Opera, Vivaldi and other browsers
## Note: The cookies-from-browser option requires that the browser has logged in to the target website and the cookies have not expired.
## Chromium browsers (Chrome, Edge, etc.) need to close all processes to read cookies, or use --ytdl-raw-options-append=cookies=cookies.txt
#ytdl-raw-options-append=cookies=[D:/cookies.txt] # Pass and use the cookies.txt file, only absolute paths are supported
#ytdl-raw-options-append=proxy=http://127.0.0.1:7890
# [Effective when using yt-dlp/youtube-dl to parse URLs] --ytdl-raw-options=<key>=<value>[,<key>=<value>[,...] ] Pass customized options to ytdl https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#usage-and-options
## It is best to append multiple parameters independently, that is, write multiple --ytdl-raw-options-append parameters https://mpv.io/manual/master/#options-ytdl-raw-options
#stream-lavf-o-append=http_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:7890 # [Effective when using libavformat to parse URLs] --stream-lavf-o-append=<key>=<value>[ ,<key>=<value>[,...]] Pass customized options to libavformat
## It is best to pass multiple parameters and append them independently, that is, write multiple --stream-lavf-o-append parameters https://mpv.io/manual/master/#options-stream-lavf-o
## Note that the proxy set by this option will also be passed to ytdl and other network requests.
#input-builtin-bindings=no # Disable loading of mpv built-in keybindings during startup. This option does not affect key bindings for externally loaded scripts
input-default-bindings=no # Disable mpv built-in keys and the --mp.add_key_binding key binding scheme of external loading scripts
## Can effectively resolve script shortcut key conflicts. After enabling, you need to specify the required shortcut keys in input.conf. 

 ##‚áò‚áòFilter part
## Set the writing format of the audio/video filter activated with MPV (supports multiple items) --af/vf=filter‚ë†=parameter‚ù∂=value:parameter‚ù∑=value,filter‚ë°...
## Only one --af and --vf can exist each. If you don't want to use only this parameter, you can split it and write it. For example, using --vf-toggle to add more filters multiple times will not overwrite the filter specified by --vf=<value>.
## Filter algorithms of the same category are mutually exclusive 

 ## Multi-channel audio track adjusts the sound of each channel to prevent background sound or vocals from being too quiet (dual-channel equipment)
#af-toggle=@dynaudnorm:lavfi=[dynaudnorm=f=500:g=31:p=0.5:m=5:r=0.9]
#af-toggle=@dynaudnorm:!dynaudnorm=p=0.65:r=0.9
## Another set of examples
#af-toggle=@loudnorm:lavfi=[loudnorm=I=-16:TP=-1.5:LRA=11]
#af-toggle=@loudnorm:!loudnorm=I=-25:TP=-1.5:LRA=4:linear=false 

 ## Choose one of three audio speed filters (the current default value is good enough)
#af=scaletempo=scale=1.0:stride=60:overlap=.20:search=14:speed=tempo
# Audio speed filter used by the old version of mpv. Example values ‚Äã‚Äãare default parameters
# Among them, scale=<N> controls additional video acceleration; stride=<N> if the value is too high, it will cause sound skipping at high speeds and echoes at low speeds. If the value is too low, the tone will be changed. Increasing the value will improve performance.
# overlap=<N> Overlap percentage, reducing the value improves separation and improves performance; search=<N> searches the length of the best overlap position (milliseconds), reducing the value improves performance
# speed=<tempo|pitch|both|none> tempo synchronizes rhythm and speed, pitch causes lag and is not used, both takes into account both rhythm and pitch, none ignores speed changes and is not used
#af=scaletempo2=min-speed=0.25:max-speed=4.0:search-interval=30:window-size=20  
# This parameter is the audio filter automatically activated by default during variable speed playback. Directly mute processing outside the speed range of min/max-speed=<N>. scaletempo2 has higher audio quality
#af=rubberband # The sound quality is between scaletempo and scaletempo2. There are many adjustable parameters. Please refer to the official documentation for details. The default parameters are used directly here. 

 #vf-toggle=format:gamma=gamma2.2 # The MPV color calibration curve target is BT.1886. This video filter is used to return to common display standards https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/issues/ 8009
#vf-toggle=fps=fps=60/1.001 # Force the video to be output at a specified frame rate (this item conflicts with frame filling). It is usually used to enhance the smoothness of scrolling bullets. It is not recommended to use --sub-fps= <value>. The numerator value (rounded) is your monitor refresh rate. 

 ##‚áò‚áòShader section
### Shader related settings are set using configuration groups. The following are only parameter examples. For specific settings, see the relevant configuration group parameters of [General Parameter Supplementary Area] and [Configuration Group] below.
## --glsl-shaders=<value> here is used to specify the shaders that are started together with MPV each time (supports multiple)
## Example of initial loading of multiple shaders
#glsl-shaders="~~/shaders/igv/KrigBilateral.glsl;~~/shaders/igv/FSRCNNX_x2_8-0-4-1.glsl;~~/shaders/igv/FSRCNNX_x2_8-0-4-1.glsl;~~/shaders/igv/SSimSuperRes.glsl;~~/shaders/igv/SSimDownscaler.glsl"

 ## --glsl-shaders-append is equivalent to --glsl-shader=<value> (note the difference from the parameters in the above description), which means appending a shader (only one item can be appended at a time) and will not overwrite it. The first --glsl-shaders=<value> specifies the shader, and this command can be appended infinitely.
#glsl-shaders-append="~~/shaders/other/PixelClipper.glsl" # Anti-ringing shader, mainly used for mpv internal EWA class scaling algorithm. Compared with the AR algorithm inside --vo=gpu-next, the performance is slightly better

#glsl-shaders-append="~~/shaders/nnedi3/nnedi3-nns32-win8x4.glsl" #Super high-quality interpolation amplification algorithm. The minimum scaling trigger ratio is 1.2, which consumes extremely high energy. nns16 ‚Üí nns32 ‚Üí nns64 ‚Üí nns128 ‚Üí nns256; win8x4 ‚Üí win8x6 has better quality but greatly improved performance.
#glsl-shaders-append="~~/shaders/ravu/ravu-zoom-ar-r3.glsl" # ravu zoom algorithm zoom variant, universal type, trigger magnification > 1, zoom to the target resolution, when it takes effect Override the specified --scale=xxxxx algorithm
#glsl-shaders-append="~~/shaders/ravu/ravu-lite-ar-r3.glsl" # ravu amplification algorithm lite variant, universal type, the minimum zoom trigger magnification is about 1.2, the sharpest variant, When taking effect, the specified --scale=xxxxx algorithm will be overwritten.

 ## The following are shader configuration groups. You can enable any of the following required configuration groups as needed (this will override the --glsl-shaders-append parameter above)
profile=NNEDI3 # Suitable for most scenes (NNEDI3-32) ## The vast majority of scenes perform well, and the adaptability to the scene is better than other configurations (suppressing aliasing and ringing artifacts). If you like versatility, use this configuration group first.
#profile=NNEDI3+ # Suitable for most scenarios (NNEDI3-64) ## In theory, NNEDI3-64 and above variants have better suppression of ringing artifacts, but the energy consumption level is doubled. You can choose whether to use it depending on the performance of the device.
#profile=AMD-FSR_EASU # Suitable for most scenarios (AMD-FSR_EASU) ## The EASU variant of AMD's FSR algorithm performs well, producing less ringing artifacts compared to the FSR and RCAS variants, and has good Picture effect. Zoom in to target resolution
#profile=ravu-zoom # Suitable for most scenarios (ravu-zoom) ## Zoom in to target resolution
#profile=FSRCNNX # Suitable for HD scenes (FSRCNNX) ## The effect is similar to madvr's NGU Sharp, but it produces more ringing artifacts and performs worse in low-resolution images
#profile=FSRCNNX+ # Suitable for SD scenes (FSRCNNX_enhance) ## Excellent suppression of ringing artifacts for low-resolution real-shot images
#profile=FSRCNNX-anime # Suitable for HD animation (FSRCNNX-anime) ## The effect is similar to madvr's NGU AA, but it produces more ringing artifacts and performs worse in low-resolution images
#profile=FSRCNNX-anime+ # Suitable for SD animation (FSRCNNX-anime_enhance) ## Excellent suppression of ringing artifacts for low-resolution anime-like images
#profile=Anime4K # Suitable for most animations (Anime4k removes artifacts and anti-aliasing) ## It can have a better suppression effect on defects such as aliasing and ringing, but there is still obvious perceptual smear degradation.
#profile=Anime4K+ # Suitable for SD animation (Anime4k high-strength anti-aliasing) ## It has a better effect on suppressing defects such as aliasing ringing artifacts and higher intensity for anime-like images. The UL variant has the best actual effect, but consumes extremely high energy and is not recommended for the time being.
