# selects subtitles synchronously during the preloaded hook, which has better
# compatability with other scripts and options
# this requires that the script predict what the default audio track will be,
# so theoretically this can be wrong on some rare occasions
# disabling this will switch the subtitle track after playback starts
preload=yes

# experimental audio track selection based on the preference json file.
# this overrides force_prection and detect_incorrect_predictions.
select_audio=no

# remove any potential prediction failures by forcibly selecting whichever
# audio track was predicted
force_prediction=no

# detect when a prediction is wrong and re-check the subtitles
# this is automatically disabled if `force_prediction` is enabled
detect_incorrect_predictions=yes

#observe audio switches and reselect the subtitles when alang changes
observe_audio_switches=yes

# Only select forced subtitles if they are explicitly stated in slang.
# By default, when searching for subtitle tracks with a specific language,
# forced subtitles will be included in the search results and treated the same as other tracks.
# This means that there's no way to write a rule that specifically excludes
# forced subtitle tracks. By enabling this forced subtitles will never be chosen unless a rule
# explicitly includes "forced" in `slang`.
