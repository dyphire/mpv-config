# Synchronize subtitle selection during preinstallation hook for better effect
# Compatibility with other scripts and options
# This requires the script to predict what the default audio track will be,
# So in theory this could be wrong in rare cases
# Disabling this feature will switch the subtitle track after playback starts
preload=yes

# Experimental audio track selection based on preference json file
# This will override force_prection and detect_incorrect_predictions
select_audio=no

# Eliminate any potential prediction failures by forcing any one to be chosen
#Audio track predicted
force_prediction=no

# Detect when predictions are wrong and recheck subtitles
# If "force_prediction" is enabled, this feature will be automatically disabled
detect_incorrect_predictions=yes

#observe audio switch and reselect subtitles when alang changes
observe_audio_switches=yes

# Only select forced subtitles that are explicitly stated in the subtitles track.
# By default, when searching for subtitle tracks in a specific language,
# Force subtitles to be included in search results the same as other tracks.
# This means there is no way to write a rule that specifically excludes forced subtitle tracks
# By enabling forced subtitles, forced subtitles will never be selected unless a rule explicitly contains "forced" in `slang`
explicit_forced_subs=no

#Specify the folder containing the "sub-select.json" file
