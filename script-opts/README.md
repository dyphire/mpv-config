### This folder stores the corresponding settings file of the MPV script

Usually, the name of the script file is the same as that of the script file, and the '-' in the script file name needs to be translated into '_' by default. The actual settings are subject to the script developer's settings. 

Script settings files should not be formatted (e.g. by adding meaningless spaces); Do not comment after the argument (you should write a separate comment on a separate line). 

The script and its settings file may not support CRLF line breaks for windows (try changing to LF). 

 the above situations may cause the script configuration file (partial) to become invalid in the process of self-modification。 

 The following are the settings files used by the built-in script of MPV：

```
console.conf
osc.conf
stats.conf
ytdl_hook.conf
```
