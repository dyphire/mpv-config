#linux:     root=~/,/

root=~/

#this feature has the potential for massive performance improvements when using addons with asynchronous IO

#if this number is too high it risks overflowing the mpv event queue, which will cause some directories to be dropped entirely

#when disabled the keybind is required to enable autoload for the file
#when enabled the keybind disables autoload for the file

#the current file will have it's watch-later config saved before being closed and re-opened
#essentially the current file will not be restarted

#note that the working directory is set as the 'current' directory regardless, so `home` will
#move the browser there even if this option is set to false

#this should only be enabled if file-browser is the only thing controlling the idle-screen,
#if multiple sources attempt to control the idle-screen at the same time it can cause unexpected behaviour.
