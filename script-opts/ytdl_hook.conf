##The first choice is to try to use ytdl to parse the url (default no). Depends on whether most url playback scenarios require ytdl parsing
try_ytdl_first=yes

##url parses the address blacklist. For format explanation, see https://mpv.io/manual/master/#options-exclude
##It is recommended to use try_ytdl_first=yes, which can reasonably speed up the resolution of network addresses.
exclude=%.avi$|%.flac$|%.flv$|%.mp3$|%.m3u$|%.m3u8$|%.m4a$|%.m4v$|%.mkv$|%.mp4 $|%.ts$|%.VOB$|%.wav$|%.webm$|%.wmw$

##When try_ytdl_first is no mpv should try to prioritize the list of URL patterns parsed by ytdl. The matching method is the same as exclude, and the example is the default value
include=^%w+%.youtube%.com/|^youtube%.com/|^youtu%.be/|^%w+%.twitch%.tv/|^twitch%.tv/

##Allow switching source tracks (disabled by default for performance reasons)

##youtube-dl The most active branch yt-dlp has a tendency to replace upstream and is actively developed https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases
##Requires youtube-dl.exe / yt-dlp.exe in the environment variable PATH, or in the directory where mpv.exe is located
##yt-dlp.exe update command: yt-dlp -U
#ytdl_path=yt-dlp
